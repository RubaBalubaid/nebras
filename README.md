# nebras

The idea of nebras application is a fun and educational game for kids it aims
to increase kid’s knowledge about several interesting topics. it will contain
3 categories (Math, geography, and religion) each category will have a
different question and each question is considered a level. So, when the
user wins the first level, level 2 will automatically be accessible, and more
points will be added to the user’s record. Also, the user’s process is saved
along with his/her account in the game’s database.
